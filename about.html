    <h1 class="about-title">About E-Waste Hub ♻️</h1>
    <p class="about-text">Hey there! We’re just a bunch of caffeine-fueled students trying to save the planet, one circuit board at a time. 😎</p>

    <p class="about-text">This platform was born from a single thought: <em>"Why does recycling feel like rocket science?"</em> So, we made it simple. You can now find recycling centers, schedule pickups, and learn cool eco-hacks — all in one place. 🌱</p>

    <p class="about-text">Our mission is to make e-waste recycling as easy as ordering your favorite food online (minus the guilt). 😅</p>

    <h3 class="about-sub">🌟 Fun Facts:</h3>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Yes, we broke a few laptops making this.</li>
      <li>Half the team runs on coffee, the other half on sheer panic.</li>
      <li>Our platform is greener than your neighbor’s lawn (no offense to anyone).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="about-text">So yeah... stick around, explore, recycle a little, and maybe laugh while you’re at it. We won’t mind 😉</p>
